# particleLife

Simulation showing complexity arising from particles interacting using simple rules

Idea from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_zmZ23grXE
Structure based on https://github.com/Hopson97/Hero

Compiled with gcc-17, uses SFML
Will probably compile with gcc-13 if you change the makefile

Run it:
```console
# install sfml
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

# compile, link and run
make
```
afterwards you can use ./sfml-app
